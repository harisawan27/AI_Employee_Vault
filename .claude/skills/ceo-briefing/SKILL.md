# CEO Briefing Generator — WEBXES Tech

Generate the Monday Morning CEO Briefing.

## Input

Read the CEO Briefing task file. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a filename, use that. Otherwise, look for the most recent `CEO_BRIEFING_*.md` file in `/Needs_Action/`.

The task file contains raw revenue data in this format:
```
- Period: <date range>
- Total Revenue: <dollar amount>
- Transaction Count: <number>
```

## Output

Write the briefing to `Plans/CEO_Briefing_<date>.md` using this format:

```markdown
# WEBXES Tech — CEO Briefing
**Week of <period> | Generated: <today's date>**

## Executive Summary
<1-2 sentence overview of the week>

## Enrichment

If `Business_Goals.md` exists, cross-reference:
- Compare revenue to monthly targets
- Note if on-track or behind

If `/Done/` has completed tasks from the past week, include a "Completed Tasks" section.

## After Writing

1. Move the source task file from `/Needs_Action/` to `/Done/`
2. Confirm the briefing file path to the user
