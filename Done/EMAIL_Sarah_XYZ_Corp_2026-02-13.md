Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to WEBXES Tech regarding your website redesign project. We appreciate your interest in our services.

We would be happy to discuss a full website redesign for XYZ Corp, including mobile responsiveness and SEO optimization. Your budget range of $5,000-$10,000 aligns well with our typical project scope for comprehensive redesigns.

To prepare an accurate quote, we would like to schedule a brief discovery call to understand your specific requirements, including:

- Current website URL and pain points
- Target audience and key functionality needs
- Design preferences and brand guidelines
- Desired timeline for completion

Would you be available for a 30-minute call this week? Please let us know a time that works for you.

Best regards,

WEBXES Tech
Digital Agency
